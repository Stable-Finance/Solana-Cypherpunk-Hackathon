# Referral Program Implementation Summary

## Overview

A complete referral program has been implemented for Stable Finance with the following features:

- **1,000 Stable Points** signup bonus for each successful referral
- **0.1 Stable Points per day** ongoing bonus while referred users hold/stake USDX
- **100 USDC minimum swap** requirement to qualify
- **Leaderboard** with combined staking + referral points
- **Dedicated Referrals page** for users to manage codes and track earnings

## Architecture

### Backend (ecosystem-api)

**Technology Stack:**
- Python FastAPI
- Google Sheets as data store (via gspread library)
- Redis for caching

**New Files:**
1. `ecosystem-api/services/referral_service.py` - Core referral logic
2. `ecosystem-api/routers/referrals.py` - API endpoints
3. `ecosystem-api/GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions

**API Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/referrals/{address}/code` | GET | Get or create referral code |
| `/api/v1/referrals/use` | POST | Record referral usage |
| `/api/v1/referrals/{address}/stats` | GET | Get referrer statistics |
| `/api/v1/referrals/leaderboard` | GET | Get leaderboard (top 100) |
| `/api/v1/staking/user/{address}` | GET | Updated to include referral points |

### Frontend (usdx-dapp)

**New Files:**
1. `usdx-dapp/src/components/Referrals.tsx` - Referrals page

**Modified Files:**
1. `usdx-dapp/src/App.tsx` - Added referrals route and navigation
2. `usdx-dapp/src/components/Swap.tsx` - Added referral code detection and submission

**Features:**
- Referral code display and sharing
- Referral code input (on both Referrals and Swap pages)
- Leaderboard table with ranking
- Stats dashboard showing earnings
- URL parameter support (`?ref=CODE123`)
- LocalStorage persistence

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Referrer shares their code:**
   - Visit `/referrals` page
   - Copy their unique referral code or share link
   - Share with friends: `https://app.trystable.co?ref=ABC123XYZ`

2. **Referred user uses code:**
   - Clicks link with `?ref=` parameter OR
   - Manually enters code on Referrals page
   - Code is saved in localStorage

3. **User swaps 100+ USDC:**
   - When user completes a swap of 100+ USDC
   - System automatically records the referral
   - Referrer receives 1,000 Stable Points instantly

4. **Daily bonus accumulates:**
   - While referred user holds/stakes USDX
   - Referrer earns 0.1 points per day
   - Calculated in real-time on leaderboard

### Data Schema

**Codes Sheet:**
- `address` - User wallet address
- `referral_code` - Unique code (9 chars: 6 from address + 3 random)
- `created_at` - Timestamp

**Referrals Sheet:**
- `referrer_address` - Person who shared the code
- `referral_code` - Code that was used
- `referred_address` - Person who used the code
- `swap_amount_usdc` - Amount swapped (must be â‰¥100)
- `swap_timestamp` - When they swapped
- `signup_bonus_paid` - Always "true"
- `created_at` - When referral was recorded

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd ecosystem-api

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Follow Google Sheets setup guide
# See GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md

# Set environment variables in .env
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/credentials.json
GOOGLE_SHEETS_REFERRAL_ID=your-spreadsheet-id

# Restart API server
python main.py
```

### 2. Frontend Build

```bash
cd usdx-dapp

# Install any new dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel or your hosting platform
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

1. Visit `/referrals` page
2. Connect wallet
3. Verify referral code is generated
4. Check Google Sheet for new entry
5. Test sharing a referral link
6. Complete a 100+ USDC swap with a referral code
7. Verify points are awarded

## Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)

```bash
# Required for referral program
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/credentials.json
GOOGLE_SHEETS_REFERRAL_ID=your-spreadsheet-id

# Existing variables
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
# ... other existing vars
```

### Frontend (.env.production)

```bash
# API endpoint
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://stable-ecosystem-api.onrender.com

# Environment
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production

# ... other existing vars
```

## Points Calculation

### Signup Bonus
- **When:** User swaps 100+ USDC with referral code
- **Amount:** 1,000 Stable Points (one-time)
- **Formula:** Fixed 1000 points

### Daily Bonus
- **When:** Continuously while referred user holds USDX
- **Amount:** 0.1 Stable Points per day per referred user
- **Formula:** `days_since_referral * 0.1 * number_of_referrals`

### Example Earnings

| Scenario | Signup Bonus | Daily Bonus (30 days) | Total |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 referral | 1,000 | 3 | 1,003 |
| 5 referrals | 5,000 | 15 | 5,015 |
| 10 referrals | 10,000 | 30 | 10,030 |
| 100 referrals | 100,000 | 300 | 100,300 |

## Leaderboard

**Columns:**
1. **Rank** - Position (ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰ for top 3)
2. **Wallet** - Truncated address
3. **Stable Points** - From staking
4. **Referrals** - Number of people referred
5. **Referral Points** - Points from referrals
6. **Total Points** - Combined total (sorted by this)

**Updates:**
- Leaderboard recalculates on each request
- Daily bonuses accrue in real-time
- Shows top 100 users by default

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend API is running
- [ ] Google Sheets integration is configured
- [ ] Referrals page loads and shows code
- [ ] Referral code can be copied
- [ ] URL parameter `?ref=CODE` is detected
- [ ] Swap page detects pending referral code
- [ ] Swap 100+ USDC triggers referral recording
- [ ] Referral appears in Google Sheet
- [ ] Leaderboard shows updated points
- [ ] User staking endpoint includes referral points

## Known Limitations

1. **Google Sheets Rate Limits:**
   - Read/write quotas may be hit with high traffic
   - Consider migrating to PostgreSQL for production scale

2. **Daily Bonus Calculation:**
   - Currently calculated based on time since referral
   - Doesn't check if user still holds USDX (future enhancement)

3. **One Referral Per User:**
   - Users can only be referred once
   - Cannot change referrer after first swap

4. **Minimum Swap Amount:**
   - 100 USDC minimum is hardcoded
   - Must update `referral_service.py` to change

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Migration:**
   - Move from Google Sheets to PostgreSQL/Supabase
   - Better scalability and performance

2. **Advanced Analytics:**
   - Referral conversion tracking
   - Time-to-swap metrics
   - Referrer performance stats

3. **Referral Tiers:**
   - Higher bonuses for top referrers
   - Special rewards at milestones

4. **USDX Hold Verification:**
   - Only award daily bonus if user still holds USDX
   - Track unstaking events

5. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - View all referrals
   - Manually adjust points
   - Export data for analysis

## Security Considerations

1. **Service Account Credentials:**
   - Never commit to git
   - Store securely on server
   - Rotate periodically

2. **Referral Code Uniqueness:**
   - Codes are generated deterministically but unique
   - Collision risk is negligible (9 chars = 13.8 billion combinations)

3. **Spam Prevention:**
   - One referral per wallet address
   - Minimum 100 USDC swap requirement
   - Could add rate limiting if needed

4. **Data Validation:**
   - All addresses validated as valid Ethereum addresses
   - Swap amounts must be positive numbers
   - Self-referrals are blocked

## Support & Maintenance

**Monitoring:**
- Check Google Sheets for new referrals
- Monitor API logs for errors
- Review leaderboard for anomalies

**Troubleshooting:**
- See `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md` for common issues
- Check API logs: `ecosystem-api/logs/`
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

**Updates:**
- Update bonus amounts in `referral_service.py`
- Modify UI text in `Referrals.tsx`
- Adjust minimum swap in `referral_service.py`
